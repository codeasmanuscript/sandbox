I think this series of workshops are a great initiative. SGS offers many workshops throughout the year, but most of them focus on "soft" skills. This workshop, however, was all about usefull, practical skills that all graduate students must learn. The instructors, Luke and Daiva were really helpful and knowledgable, and I really enjoyed learning from them. Although I knew some of the git concepts and had used git/github using a GUI, learning to use the command line helped me fully understand the concepts and have more control over everything.
